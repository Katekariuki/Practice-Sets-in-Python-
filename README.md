## Practice-Sets-in-Python- ðŸ”¥
---
- A **set** in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Unlike lists or tuples, sets do not allow duplicate values, and the items are not stored in any particular order.
---
**ðŸ”‘ Key characteristics of sets:**

  - Unordered: The elements do not have a specific order.
  - Unique: Sets automatically remove duplicate values.
  - Mutable: You can add or remove elements from a set.
  - Sets are denoted by curly brackets {}.
  
  :one: Is A a subset of B.
  ```
  A={19,22,24,20,25,26}
  B={19,22,20,25,26,24,28,27}
  set_diff=A<=B
  set_diff
  ```
  :two: Set Intersections
  ```
  common_items=A.intersection(B)
  print(common_items)
  ```
